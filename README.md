# Clickbait Post Type Classification and Clickbait Generation

The paper explores transformer-based models, transitioning from non-transformer to hybrid approaches with LSTM, BiLSTM, and BERT, achieving a notable 62.0% accuracy in spoiler classifi- cation. Additionally, a T5 transformer model is introduced for spoiler generation. The results underscore the effectiveness of our system in addressing spoiler challenges, contributing to the evolution of spoiler classification and generation
